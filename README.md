# Intro
I've always loved games and found that game programming resembles the foundations of computers and computer science therefore i always tried to build games but this one is different because im starting from scratch using a really basic language ( C ) - and i am having fun :D

* WOA is a game project for learning purposes.

Note (9/12/2023) : After playing with SDL a little bit i've decided to lower the layer and play with something that requires more research and more in depth studying so i am going to make a platform layer for Linux using X11 then maybe in the future (not sure when yet) i will make a Windows platform layer too! :)


# Get Started

First you have to install SDL2 then:

Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/asaadziad/WOA
 ```

then compile the project on your machine and run the executable.
